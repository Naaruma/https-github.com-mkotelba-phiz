# ![PHIZ project logo](https://github.com/esacinc/phiz/raw/master/phiz-web-core/src/main/webapp/static/images/phiz-logo-48x48.png) The Public Health Immunization Data Exchange (PHIZ) Project

## Purpose

The Public Health Immunization Data Exchange (PHIZ) project is a centralized hub that enables interoperability between formerly isolated Immunization Information Systems (IIS) instances.

## Background

[IIS](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/index.html) is a program run by the [National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)](http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/), an institute within the [Office of Infectious Diseases](http://www.cdc.gov/oid/) of the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](http://www.cdc.gov/). On the technical side, it currently consists of a [SOAP web service definition](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/technical-guidance/SOAP/wsdl.html) currently implemented by and in production for many separate government bodies (States and cities).

This initiative has been sponsored by the CDC and is being managed by the [Office of the National Coordinator for Healthcare IT](http://www.healthit.gov/).

## Pilot Phase

This project was preceded by a pilot phase, as encompassed by the [Immunization Registry Inter-Jurisdictional Interoperability Pilot project](https://code.google.com/p/iis-hub-pilot/).
